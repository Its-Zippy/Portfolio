Personal development portfolio

HELLO, I‚Äôm @Its-Zippy

A young student from Australia studing Cyber Security, with the hopes to continue studying software development/CS, or alternitivly get a job in the field.
I'm on Git to get some industry experience, meet people with similar interests, collaborate on projects and get help to develop myself and my skills further as an aspiring "programer"! I'm wanting to use Git to create a portfolio of my development and reach like minded individuals. Working in a collaborative environment and having my development posted will help me stay motivated to learn, which is my current focus 'to learn'. 

- ‚ú® I‚Äôm interested in game development as a personal endevor/hobby, I love games and the creation of Indie titles, they seem to be made with a love for the craft and have more heart and soul put into them than triple A games.
- I also have an intrest in "pen testing" and IT security, and enjoy learing about the methodologies and skills used in this field aswell. Software development and programming is the general interest but I haven't found the field I want to specialise in.

- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning C++ but I'm still just learning the fundamentals. I have been using SoloLearn to learn but would totaly be open to other platforms/devices to learn. I'm also learning pyhton, I have a better understanding of python and the fundamentals of the language over C++ but I know I still have alot to learn. Simmilarly I have used SoloLearn to learn python but I have also create mini projects to apply my skills such as an AI that play a CLI version of "Tic Tac Toe". Very simple but we've all been there.

- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on simple projects to expand my repitoir of skills and more importantly, to really lock down the fundamentals of software development. Any simple projects using python are of interest even if the work could be done alone I would love to help develop even a simple system.

I am just currently wanting to learn and develop my software development/programing skills.
